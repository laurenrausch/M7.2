# Running my website!

## Step One

Before running, clone this repository and run the following commands:

```bash
npm install
```
## Step Two

You can run the website through Live Preview VSCode extension which will start the local server for the webpage, run it with the following keystroke: 

    Ctrl+Shift+P
    Live Preview: Start Sever

From here you should be able to use the website!
You can also use the same URL from the live preview and use it in an actual browser page and be able to see the same result. (I recommend this method because then you can see the full page better.)
```
